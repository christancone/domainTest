      <b>What Exactly Is .LK Domain?</b><br/><br/><br/>
      We are the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Sri Lanka. Since 1990, individuals, businesses, religious bodies and non-profit organizations have adopted .lk web addresses to make their mark on the internet. .LK enables both companies registered in Sri Lanka as well as the international firms, who do not have a local presence, to register their domains in .lk. For companies with operations in Sri Lanka, a .lk address inspires consumer confidence and encourages people to “buy Sri Lankan.” The LK Domain Registry offers excellent opportunities for businesses to get the addresses they need.
